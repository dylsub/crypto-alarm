Welcome to Crypto-Alarm (BETA)

Turn your audio up and select "Enable Alarm"

Next, set your desired ranges for any coins you hold interest in

When the actual price falls out of the range, the background will turn red and the alarm will sound.

Use this to get some rest without constantly checking for prices in the middle of the night

Built with Alchemy SDK and React
